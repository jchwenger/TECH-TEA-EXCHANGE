        "- **Endpoint:** This notebook uses the `/api/generate` endpoint in streaming mode. Ensure your Ollama configuration supports streaming.\n",
        "- **History Trimming:** The `trim_history` function takes the full text and returns only the last _n_ lines. Setting _n_ to 0 uses the full conversation history.\n",
        "- **Streaming:** Tokens are printed as they arrive and then accumulated into a complete response, which is then used for the next iteration.\n",
        "- **Dependencies:** This notebook requires the `requests` library. If not installed, run `pip install requests` in your terminal.\n",
        "- **Recursion:** Each iteration uses the new output (trimmed if specified) as the prompt for the next iteration. Use with care to avoid runaway loops."
